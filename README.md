# To-do-list
I created a to-do list page as an introduction web development project. Used HTML, JS and CSS only.

I asked Chat-GPT to generate the project challenge and it's functionality demands, this was the result:

🎯 **Challenge: Smart To-Do List**

📝 **Description:**

Create a web application where the user can easily manage their daily tasks. The page should be functional, organized, and interactive — all without using frameworks, libraries, or any backend.

🧠 **Skills you will practice:**

- DOM manipulation (create, update, and delete elements)
- Click, keyboard, and user interaction events
- State management using arrays/objects
- Input validation and visual feedback
- Layout organization with HTML and CSS

✅ **Required features:**

1. **Add Task**
    
    The user can type a task name and add it to the list.
    
    Prevent the addition of empty tasks.
    
2. **Mark Task as Completed**
    
    The user can click a task to mark it as done (and click again to unmark).
    
    Completed tasks should look different (e.g., strikethrough text or a different color).
    
3. **Delete Task**
    
    The user can delete individual tasks from the list.
    

🔁 **Bonus features (extra challenge):**

1. **Clear All Tasks**
    
    A button that deletes the entire list at once (with confirmation).
    
2. **Edit Task**
    
    The user can double-click a task to edit its content.
    
3. **Display Task Count**
    
    Show how many tasks are pending and how many are completed.
    

👤 **Expected user experience:**

- Simple, clean, and responsive interface
- Interactions with visual feedback (e.g., light animations, color changes)
- Easy to add, view, complete, and delete tasks



So then I created a project that satisfies these demands.
Note: for the 'Edit Task' Bonus feature, I decided to just leave the task field as free text input
for the user to type, instead of setting a double-click event as the GPT suggestion mentioned.
